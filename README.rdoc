## Introduction

üìöüêõ

Bookworms aims to solve the problem of connecting book lovers and aspiring readers to book clubs that suit their needs. The app was built as part of a weeklong project, and was used as an excuse to expose us to new technologies such as AngularJS and utilisation of the Rails asset pipeline. Bookworms allows users to create and join book clubs, filtering by genre, location and time.
